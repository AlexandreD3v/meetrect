# MEETRECT FOR [DOLIBARR ERP CRM](https://www.dolibarr.org)

## Features

Meetrect is a link/url redirector, which allows a user to provide a custom Dolibarr link to redirect a viewer to a specific url or virtual call room, allowing more than one Dolibarr user to manage an input url to direct to different virtual rooms that have the same objective.

## How it works
In the "My rooms" screen, you will see the rooms that you are as host (room administrator) and in "All rooms" all rooms registered in the system will be listed.
Click on the "New" button, register the room information and save.
When there is more than one room pointing to the same input url, only one of the records can have the active status.

### ATTENTION
In order for the user to access the input url, it is necessary to enable access to the module's public interface in Settings -> Modules / Applications -> Meetrect Module configuration button.
